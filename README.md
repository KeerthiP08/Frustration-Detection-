**FRUSTRATION DETECTION ON REVIEWS USING MACHINE LEARNING** 
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model for detecting frustration in reviews.
The model will be trained on a large dataset of customer reviews to accurately identify instances where customers express frustration. 
The project will focus on using natural language processing techniques to analyze the sentiment and emotion expressed in the text of the reviews.
The model will be designed to classify reviews as frustrated or non-frustrated based on their content.
The outcome of this project will provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction and help businesses to identify and address common pain points that lead to customer frustration. 
The final deliverables will include a trained machine learning model that demonstrates the model's capabilities.
